## How we plan to approach this project

User opens application to welcome screen that displays list of registered cafes and a register cafe button

**Register Cafe**
2. User clicks button to register a cafe
3. The register-cafe window allows user to input the following details:
  * Cafe name, address, phone number, email
  * The general business hours of cafe

**Cafe window**
User clicks onto registered cafe and opens a new window, contains:
* displays summary of cafe details, which can be viewed in more detail
* displays this week's roster
* a [+ new roster] button
* a view staff button
* a view rosters button

**New roster**
x Cannot generate new roster if staff count == 0
x for simplicity sake... start date is always going to be from a Monday to Sunday
x Runs our algorithm

  **algorithm**
  

**Staff window**
